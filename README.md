# Data Projects Portfolio

A curated collection of data analytics, data science, and data engineering projects built with Python, SQL, and modern data tools.  
This repository focuses on **real-world problems**, clean workflows, and clear validation of results.

The goal is simple: turn raw data into reliable insights and reproducible systems.
